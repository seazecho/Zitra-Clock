# Zitra

Zitra is a simple digital clock built around the idea of the present moment. It shows the time clearly, without visual noise, and uses a calm interface that can switch between light and dark depending on the setting. The focus is not speed or urgency, but continuity : time as something that keeps moving on its own.

The project is intentionally minimal. It supports both 12-hour and 24-hour formats, fullscreen mode, and adapts well to different screen sizes. Each interaction is kept small and deliberate so the clock stays in the background rather than demanding attention.

Zitra isn’t meant to help you manage time or make you more productive.  
It simply exists to show it: steady, uninterrupted, and always present.
